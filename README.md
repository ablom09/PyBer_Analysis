**OVERVIEW:**

We have been tasked with writing an analysis for the makers of PyBer to provide data and offer advice into how the total fares between various city types can affect the company as a whole. More specifically, it would appear as though Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities experience differing fares for PyBer’s product and therefore could contain potential market growth in addition. In helping them reach conclusions, we will be creating various data frames and a final line graph to help reach insights in managing these conclusions.

**RESULTS:**

Fare rates appear to have experienced a general increase in both Urban and Suburban areas. In rural cities, however a negligible difference was observed. Urban areas experienced the highest rates of all three types consistently throughout the time period covered and are also the highest source of revenue production considering both its’ fare rates and volume of rides.

In fact, peak fare rates (close to $1,400 in February and close to the end of the timeframe) in Suburban areas were not able to achieve a fare rate that exceeded the Urban cities’ lowest rate which occurred in January at close to $1,700.

Beyond this, it would appear as though rural areas experienced the lowest numbers of drivers throughout the period observed despite having the highest fare rate amongst its drivers. Urban areas showed the highest volume of drivers at 2405 whilst also having the lowest fare for its drivers at approximately $16.57 .

**SUMMARY**

**1)**	Given the trends highlighted above, I would opt the company of PyBer to pursue further investment and development into urban areas. Though some profitability remains in suburban areas, Urban cities experienced the highest fares consistently and without any real contest when compared to both Suburban and Rural cities. This trend is likely to continue going forward.

**2)**	To help meet this potential growth in profitability in investing in urban areas, I would also encourage PyBer to invest in more drivers for Urban areas. Despite having the largest volume of drivers anyways, Urban city drivers also contain the lowest fare rates when compared to more costly suburban and rural drivers.

**3)**	Finally, because of rural cities consistent non-profitability, it is advised to potentially remove PyBer’s business from rural areas altogether after the full scale of operating costs are observed. Rural areas simply don’t generate the revenue that Suburban and Urban areas make and experience the highest driver fares. Because we don’t have a detailed breakdown of PyBer’s accounts and financial chart, a secondary study would likely need to be performed to determine Rural areas’ overall net profitability as a market worth investing in.
